# Asteroids - Python and Arcade Library
A remake of the classic asteroids game using python and the arcade library. Much like the original game, but there are some fun new features added. 
(Programmed using Object Oriented Programming)

## Getting Started
---
Make sure you have Python 3.8.0 or newer and arcade 2.5.5 or new installed 
and running on your machine. You can install Arcade by opening a terminal 
and running the following command.
```
python3 -m pip install arcade
```
After you've installed the required libraries, open a terminal and browse to the 
project's root folder. Start the program by running the following command.
```
python3 asteroids_game.py
```
You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. Start your IDE 
and open the project folder. Select the asteroids_game module inside the Asteroids folder and
click the "run" icon.

## Project Structure

The project files and folders are organized as follows:
